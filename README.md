# The Miking Interactive Programmatic Modeling (IPM) Environment

The goals of the Miking IPM project are to:

* Build a complete interactive programmatic modeling (IPM) environment,
  where code and textual models can be edited in any text editor, and
  where the models are visualized using a web browser.

* Support model visualization, including, but not limited to:
automata (NFA, DFA), timed automata, tree structures, directed and
undirected graphs, and electrical circuits.

* Support parameter settings in the generated models, which are fed
  back to the Miking environment.

* Enabled interactions with the execution of models (state changes).

* Provide a server that watches file updates and acts as a local web server.

* Create an integration with markdown converters, where the visualized
  models can be used in Latex environments and on static web pages.

### Getting Started

Before you can start visualizing your models inside a web browser, you need to 
install the following Node packages using NPM (Node Package Manager): http-server

	npm install -g browser-sync


### Flow plan:

1. The server listens to changes in the file called **miking-ipm/src/server/model.mc** and will call the parser that transforms the MCore project into an AST and generates a JSON. 

2. The program that reads the JSON and visualizes the state machine is then invoked and that should update the **miking-ipm/src/visual/index.html** file. The browser automatically updates then.

##### Following steps:

Re-create this whole scenario in OCaml in order to decrease dependancies.
