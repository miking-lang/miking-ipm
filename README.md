# The Miking Interactive Programmatic Modeling (IPM) Environment

The goals of the Miking IPM project are to:

* Build a complete interactive programmatic modeling (IPM) environment,
  where code and textual models can be edited in any text editor, and
  where the models are visualized using a web browser.

* Support model visualization, including, but not limited to:
automata (NFA, DFA), timed automata, tree structures, directed and
undirected graphs, and electrical circuits.

* Support parameter settings in the generated models, which are fed
  back to the Miking environment.

* Enabled interactions with the execution of models (state changes).

* Provide a server that watches file updates and acts as a local web server.

* Create an integration with markdown converters, where the visualized
  models can be used in Latex environments and on static web pages.


### Getting Started

###### **MENTION!** 
This does not work with Safari as a browser, please test it with a different browser for the moment (Chrome and Firefox work)


Before you can start visualizing your models inside a web browser, you need to
install the following Node packages using NPM (Node Package Manager): browser-sync.

	npm install  browser-sync


This is how you would write your DFA:

Starting State:

	let startState = X_i

States (integers):

	let states = [X_1,X_2,X_3,...]

Labels (characters at the moment):

	let alfabeth = [Symbol_1, Symbol_2,..]

Transitions:

	let transitions = [(X_i,X_j,Symbol_h),...]

Accepted States:

	let acceptStates = [X_i,X_j,...]

To construct a DFA use this function:

	let your_dfa = dfaConstr states transitions alfabeth startState acceptStates

To create the visualizer, make sure to use either of this two:

	let visual = dfaVisualNoInput your_dfa in
	print visual

or if you want to see the input:

	let visual = dfaVisual your_dfa input in
	print visual

You can start the server for watching your file using this command and sourcing your **.mc** file (this would be if your file is in the root directory of the project):

	node src/visual/boot.js your_file.mc

This will prompt you to the port on your localhost on which the server is started, now if you modify and save the dfa, it should generate a file called **data-source.js** and reflect the update in the browser immediately. The generated file will appear in the src/visual/webpage directory.

### Example

There is a **test.mc** in the root folder of the project which already contains a DFA as a starting point. If you want to write your own, make sure to source the **gen.mc** properly:

	include "path/to/gen.mc"

##### TO DO:

- Handling errors on display
- Generic data-types for labels and states
- Method for the next button to check input
- Instead of passing transitions, pass the an array of states
- Handling wrong input on not-allowed transitions (something like "this is not an accepted transition input")
- Ocaml server
- Extending the input from an array of strings to an array of tuples
- Planning on how to get modifications from the browser to the source-file
- Adding more modelling subjects (electric circuits, tree structures, directed/undirected graphs)
