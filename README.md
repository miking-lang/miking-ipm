# The Miking Interactive Programmatic Modeling (IPM) Environment

The goals of the Miking IPM project are to:

* Build a complete interactive programmatic modeling (IPM) environment,
  where code and textual models can be edited in any text editor, and
  where the models are visualized using a web browser.

* Support model visualization, including, but not limited to:
automata (NFA, DFA), timed automata, tree structures, directed and
undirected graphs, and electrical circuits.

* Support parameter settings in the generated models, which are fed
  back to the Miking environment.

* Enabled interactions with the execution of models (state changes).

* Provide a server that watches file updates and acts as a local web server.

* Create an integration with markdown converters, where the visualized
  models can be used in Latex environments and on static web pages.
