-- The input for simulation is given here as the second argument

-- Last argument is a list that maps states to displayNames.
-- The purpose is to visualize a state's name differently if
-- needed. This examples maps the state "s0" to the output name
-- of "start state".
-- Leave it empty for printing the actual names of the states.
